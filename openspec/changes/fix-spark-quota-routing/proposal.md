## Why

Separately metered Codex models can remain usable through fresh per-account quota telemetry even when the general upstream model catalog omits them. `codex-lb` currently treats that catalog omission as definitive account-level non-support and rejects `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` with `no_plan_support_for_model` before evaluating fresh Spark quota data.

## What Changes

- Allow fresh additional-quota telemetry to provide account-specific eligibility evidence for a mapped, separately metered model when the general per-account catalog omits that model.
- Preserve model plan and service-tier filtering before additional-quota availability, exhaustion, health, cooldown, and routing gates are evaluated.
- Carry the exact normalized quota-backed catalog-omission admission decision into HTTP bridge sessions so compatible later turns can reuse the selected upstream without synchronous quota I/O.
- Add regression coverage for fresh, missing, stale, and exhausted Spark quota evidence plus two-turn HTTP bridge reuse.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `model-catalog-compat`: Define how routing reconciles authoritative general account catalogs with fresh account-specific additional-quota evidence for separately metered models.

## Impact

- Account candidate filtering and admission provenance in `app/modules/proxy/load_balancer.py`.
- HTTP bridge reuse in `app/modules/proxy/_service/support.py` and `app/modules/proxy/_service/http_bridge/mixin.py`.
- Spark and future separately metered model routing that uses the additional-quota registry.
- Focused load-balancer and bridge regression coverage; no API schema or database migration changes.
